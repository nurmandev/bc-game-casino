    Google Authenticator offers an <strong>additional layer of security</strong> for your account. It is a software token that supports a <strong>two-step verification</strong> process. To use Google Authenticator, a mobile phone is required as it functions as a mobile app. It can also work offline.
  </p>

  <p>
    Google Authenticator generates <strong>one-time passwords (OTP)</strong> using a time-based algorithm. Upon launching the app, it displays a six-digit, randomly generated number or one-time password. If you have enabled <strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> for your account, you will need to enter both your standard password and this one-time password. This two-step process significantly enhances your account security by ensuring that your account cannot be accessed with just your username and password.
  </p>

  <p>
    We place a <strong>high value on player security</strong> and strongly recommend using Google Authenticator. This minor additional step can significantly reduce potential stress and worry about unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Google Authenticator is enabled, you will be required to complete <strong>2FA each time you log in or make a withdrawal</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, it is <strong>advisable to print out the QR code or write down the manual recovery code</strong> needed to recover your account. This precaution is crucial in case your mobile phone is lost or damaged.
