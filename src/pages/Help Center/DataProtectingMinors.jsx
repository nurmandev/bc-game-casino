      Betting at an online casino is primarily for recreational purposes. However, a small percentage of individuals may experience a loss of control while gambling. It is crucial to understand that gambling should not be viewed as a source of income or a way to pay off debts. Monitoring the amount of time and money spent daily at an online casino is advisable.

      BC.CO only accepts players who are at least 18 years old and implements all necessary measures to prevent underage individuals from registering and participating in our casino activities. The casino reserves the right to request identification, and if a player is not of legal gambling age, they will be denied access to the website. However, we acknowledge that despite the pervasive reach of the Internet, minors under the age of 18 may still manage to register and gamble at online casinos. Consequently, we strongly urge parents to collaborate in safeguarding their children from unrestricted access to gambling websites. Specialized software is available to help in this regard. For more information, please refer to the websites listed below.
