Incorrect time and/or date of an Event is not a reason for voiding bets unless expressly stated in these rules.</p>

    <p><strong>5.2.</strong> The Sportsbook platform may display live scores for informational purposes; however, this information is not guaranteed and should not be used for settling bets.</p>

    <p><strong>5.3.</strong> Bets on an Event (including all Markets within that Event) are settled after the Event concludes and the official results are announced.</p>

    <p><strong>5.4.</strong> The result of an Event will be determined on the date of the Event's conclusion, except where the official result is provided later. If Events occur outside official competitions, bets will be settled based on information provided by the Event organizer.</p>

    <p><strong>5.5.</strong> If an Event has not completed within 48 hours of its official start time, bets may be void, except for specific cases, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Bets placed on completed periods</li>
        <li>Events that naturally take longer than 30 hours (e.g., golf tournaments)</li>
        <li>Sport-specific exceptions as defined in the rules</li>
      </ul>

    <p><strong>5.6.</strong> If an Event does not start within 12 hours from the scheduled start time, all bets are void.</p>

    <p><strong>5.9.</strong> Bets are placed on outcomes regardless of the score at the time of placement. Incorrect displayed scores outside standard metrics (e.g., soccer goals, red cards) do not void bets.</p>

    <p><strong>5.10.</strong> Bets on a specific period only count the scoring during that period, unaffected by prior or subsequent events.</p>

      <div>
          <p><strong>1.37.1.</strong> <em>Goal/Own Goal:</em> Governing bodies' rules differ; OPTA reflects official decisions. Normally, a goal is awarded if the original attempt is on target, while an own goal is awarded if the attempt is off target but deflected into the goal by an opponent.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>Goes into the net regardless of intent.</li>
              <li>Would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper or stopped by the last defending player (last-line block).</li>
              <li>Goes over or wide of the goal without making contact with another player.</li>
              <li>Would have gone over or wide but was stopped by a goalkeeper or outfield player.</li>
              <li>Directly hits the frame of the goal without scoring.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Blocked shots are not counted as shots.</p>
          <p><strong>1.37.3.</strong> <em>Shots on Goal:</em> A goal attempt is classified as a shot on goal if:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>It goes into the net regardless of intent.</li>
              <li>It would have gone into the net but for being saved by the goalkeeper or stopped by the last defending player (last-line block).</li>

          <p>Shots that hit the goal frame are not considered shots on goal unless they result in a goal. Shots blocked by a non-last-man player are also not considered shots on goal.</p>
          <p><strong>1.37.4.</strong> <em>Goal Assist:</em> A goal assist is the final touch (pass, pass-cum-shot, or other touch) leading to a goal. Deflected passes are only considered assists if the receiving player was likely to receive the ball without the deflection. Own goals, direct free kicks, direct corner goals, and penalties do not count as assists.</p>
          <p><strong>1.37.5.</strong> <em>Tackle:</em> A tackle is when a player connects with the ball in a ground challenge, successfully taking the ball away from the opponent in possession:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Tackle Won:</strong> The tackler or a teammate regains possession, or the ball goes out of play safely.</li>
              <li><strong>Tackle Lost:</strong> The ball goes to an opponent after the tackle.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Both are successful tackles, but the outcome differs based on ball possession. Interceptions (cutting out a pass) are not considered tackles.</p>

        <strong>18.21. Match Milestones</strong>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> How many of the specified milestone (50/100) will be scored in total in the match?</p>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> This is determined by how many individual innings of 50+ or 100+ are scored in the match. A score of over 100 would count as both a 50 and a 100. In limited overs matches, bets will be void if it has not been possible to complete at least 80% of the overs scheduled to be bowled due to external factors, including bad weather, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined before the reduction.</p>

        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> In limited overs matches, bets will be void if it has not been possible to complete at least 80% of the overs scheduled to be bowled due to external factors, including bad weather, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined before the reduction. In drawn First Class matches, bets will be void if fewer than 200 overs have been bowled, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined. All runs, including extras, count towards settlement. Super overs do not count. For the Hundred, an over will consist of 5 legal deliveries, so a full innings will be made up of 20 overs. All other rules remain the same as other limited overs formats.</p>

        <strong>18.23. Match Top Batter</strong>
        <p><strong>Description of the market:</strong> Which batter will score the most runs in the match?</p>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> The result of this market is determined on the batter with the highest individual score in the match. In limited overs matches, bets will be void if it has not been possible to complete at least 50% of the overs scheduled to be bowled in either innings at the time the bet was placed due to external factors, including bad weather. Top batters bets for First Class matches apply only to the first innings of each team and will be void if fewer than 200 overs have been bowled, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined. If a player was named at the toss but later is removed as a concussion sub, that player will still be counted, as will the replacement player. If a batter does not bat but was named in the starting XI, bets on that batter will stand. If a batter is substituted in after the in-play market has been offered, the original market will be removed and settled as normal even if the substitute scores the highest individual score. A new market with updated selections may be offered. When two or more players score the same number of runs, dead-heat rules will apply. Runs scored in a super over do not count.</p>

        <p><strong>Description of the market:</strong> Which bowler will take the most wickets in the match?</p>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> The result of this market is determined on the bowler with the most wickets in the match. In limited overs matches, bets will be void if it has not been possible to complete at least 50% of the overs scheduled to be bowled in either innings at the time the bet was placed due to external factors, including bad weather. Top bowler bets for First Class matches apply only to the first innings of each team and will be void if fewer than 200 overs have been bowled, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined. If a player was named at the toss but later is removed as a concussion sub, that player will still be counted, as will the replacement player. If a bowler does not bowl but was named in the starting XI, bets on that bowler will stand. If a substitute (concussion or otherwise) not named in the starting XI takes the most wickets, bets on the market will be void. If two or more bowlers have taken the same number of wickets, the bowler who has conceded the fewest runs will be the winner. If there are two or more bowlers with the same wickets taken and runs conceded, dead heat rules will apply. Wickets taken in a super over don’t count. If no bowlers take a wicket in an innings then all bets will be void.</p>

    <div class="sub-section-title">1. General rules applicable to esports</div>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.</span> All esports markets are based on in-game score events or results at the end of a scheduled match/map. All settlements will occur using the official score and results, which are declared on the official video stream or the in-game stream of the relevant matches.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.2.</span> All match start dates and times displayed for Esports matches are for indication purposes only and are not guaranteed to be correct. Bets will stand if a match is offered with an incorrect date and/or time.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.3.</span> If a match is paused/postponed and not rescheduled to a later time within 24 hours of the actual scheduled start time, then all bets on that match will be voided.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.4.</span> If the name of a player/team/tournament is misspelled, all bets will still stand unless it’s obvious that the misspelled name is the same as a different entity/person.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.5.</span> If a team name is changed due to a team leaving the organization, joining another organization, or due to an official change of team name, all bets will stand.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.6.</span> If the organizer of the event allows for stand-ins and there is an official result, all bets will be resulted as normal.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.7.</span> In the case where there is an overruling of a match result by the organizer due to unforeseen circumstances - such as cheating - all bets on that match will be voided. This rule is applicable within 72 hours from the end of the match, after which the sportsbook will not change the result of the tickets.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.8.</span> If a match has been declared as a walkover win by the tournament organizer, all bets will be void.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.9.</span> If one team retires during a match, only wagers on the completed individual maps will be resulted. Match market, match side markets, and all other undecided map markets will be voided. Bets placed on any following maps that will be completed will be resulted with the official results. However, any and all live offers will be suspended on this match and moved to a new match with a different match ID that genuinely reflects the state of the match. The only exemption to this rule would be in this situation: Team A wins map 1 and proceeds to forfeit map 2. In this case, we would void all wagers on all undecided match and map 2 markets and continue our offer within map 3 of the match.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.10.</span> All markets consider overtime, unless expressly stated otherwise in the market name.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.11.</span> If the match format is changed or differs from the one which is being offered, the sportsbook reserves the right to void all bets.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.12.</span> If the fixture is listed incorrectly, the sportsbook reserves the right to void all bets.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.13.</span> If a match is played before the scheduled start date/time, all bets placed after the actual start of the match will be refunded. Bets placed before the actual start of the match will stand.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.14.</span> If a match or map is replayed due to an organizer or technical issues, all affected markets will be voided, while the replayed matches or maps will be handled separately as a new match.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">1.15.</span> If a game on the map starts with less than ten players, all bets on that map will be voided.</p>

    <div class="sub-section-title">2.1. CS:GO rules</div>
    <p><span class="highlight">2.1.1.</span> If one of the players disconnects and is unable to reconnect or be replaced for the rest of the map, both teams decide to continue 4v5, and they play at least 5 rounds. All affected bets on that map, match, and match side markets will be voided.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">2.2.</span> If a team retires, receives a win by admin decision, or is disqualified before all scheduled rounds of a map are played, all undecided bets on that map and match will be voided.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">2.3.</span> Rounds 1-15 constitute the first half of CS:GO maps.</p>
    <p><span class="highlight">2.4.</span> In the case of a round restart, all bets will stand. All markets will be resolved based on the official score.</p>

        question:"IV. Esports Solution Betting Rules",
        answer:(
            <div>
              <div class="section">
    <div class="sub-section-title">1.1. General Rules</div>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.1.</span> Sportsbook platform reserves the right to cancel any bet made on obviously “bad” odds (e.g. odds that include typo, back-office error, fixed matches), switched odds, or a bet made after an event has started or a match was affected by obvious technical problems.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.2.</span> All bets will be settled when the outcome of the market has taken place.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.3.</span> Market "Match" (1X2) is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) outcome of a match or event. The options are: "1" = Home team, or team listed to the left side of the offer; "X" = Draw, or the selection in the middle; "2" = Away team, or team listed to the right side of the offer.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.4.</span> Market "Correct Score" is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) exact score of a match or event.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.5.</span> Market "Over/Under" (Totals) is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) amount of a predefined occurrence (e.g. goals, points, corners, rebounds, penalty minutes, etc.). Should the total amount of the listed occurrences be exactly equal to the betting line, then all bets on this offer will be declared void. Example: an offer where the betting line is 128.0 points and the match ends with the result 64-64 will be declared void.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.6.</span> Market "Odd/Even" is where it is possible to bet on the (partial or definite) amount of a predefined occurrence (e.g. goals, points, corners, rebounds, penalty minutes, etc.). "Odd" is 1,3,5, etc.; "Even" is 0,2,4, etc.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.7.</span> Market "Half time/Full time" is where it is possible to bet on the result in half time and the final outcome of the match. E.g. if at Half time the score is 1-0 and the match ends 1-1, the winning outcome is 1/X. The bet is void if the regular time of the match is played in a different time format than those listed in the bet (i.e., other than two halves).</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.8.</span> Market "Period betting" is where it is possible to bet on the outcome of each separate period within a match/event.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.9.</span> Market "Draw No Bet" is where it is possible to bet on either "1" or "2" as defined in 1.1.3. It is also common practice to refer to "Draw No Bet" in cases where no draw odds are offered. Should the specific match contain no winner (e.g., match ends as a draw) or the particular occurrence does not happen (e.g., Draw No Bet and match ends 0-0), the stakes will be refunded.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.10.</span> Market "Handicap" is where it is possible to bet on whether the chosen outcome will be victorious once the listed handicap is added/subtracted (as applicable) to the match/period/total score to which the bet refers. In those circumstances where the result after the adjustment of the handicap line is exactly equal to the betting line, then all bets on this offer will be declared void.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.11.</span> Market Asian Handicap: Home team (-1.75) vs Away team (+1.75). This means that the stake is divided into 2 equal bets and placed on the outcomes -1.5 and -2.0. For the bet to be fully paid out at the listed odds, Team A must win the match with a bigger margin than both of their listed handicaps (i.e., 3 goals or more margin). In the eventuality that Team A wins with only a 2-goal margin, the bet will be considered as partially won with a full payout on the -1.5 part of the bet and a refund on the -2.0 side since the outcome on that part of the bet would be considered a “tie.” Should the match produce any other outcome, including a Team A victory with only a 1-goal margin, the whole stake would be lost. Away teams are given a +1.75 goal advantage in the match. This means that the stake is divided into 2 equal bets and placed on the outcomes +1.5 and +2.0.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.12.</span> Market "Double Chance" is where it is possible to bet simultaneously on two (partial or definite) outcomes of a match or event. The options are: 1X, 12, and X2 with "1", "X", and "2" as defined above.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.13.</span> Market "Team to score first and win" refers to the listed team scoring the first goal in the match and going on to win the match. Should there be no goals in the match, all bets will be settled as void.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.14.</span> Bets on "Quarter / Half / Period X" refer to the result/score achieved in the relevant timeframe and do not include any other points/goals/events tallied from other parts of the event/match. Bets will be void if the match is played in any other format but the one stipulated in the offer.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.15.</span> Bets on "Result at end of Quarter / Half / Period X…" refer to the result of the match/event after the termination of the stipulated time frame and will take into account all other points/goals/events tallied from previous parts of the event/match.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.16.</span> Bets on "Race to X Points / Race to X Goals..." and similar offers refer to the team/participant reaching the earliest the particular tally of points/goals/events. If the offer lists a timeframe (or any other period restriction), it will not include any other points/goals/events tallied from other parts of the event/match which are not related to the mentioned time frame. Should the listed score not be reached within the stipulated timeframe (if any), all bets will be declared void, unless otherwise stated.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.17.</span> Bets on "Winner of Point X / Scorer of Goal X" and similar offers refer to the team/participant scoring/winning the listed occurrence. For the settlement of these offers, no reference to events happening prior to the listed occurrence will be taken into consideration. Should the listed event not be scored/won within the stipulated timeframe (if any), all bets will be declared void, unless otherwise stated.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.18.</span> Any reference for a team to win all halves/periods (e.g., Team to win both halves) means that the listed team must score more goals than its opponent during all the stipulated halves/periods of the match.</p>

    <div class="sub-section-title">1.2. Basketball Market Rules</div>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.2.1.</span> Markets do not consider overtime unless otherwise stated.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.2.2.</span> If a match ends before the Xth point is reached, this market is considered void (cancelled). Who scores Xth point? (incl. OT), Which team will win race to X points? (incl. OT).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <div class="sub-section-title">1.3. Cricket Market Rules</div>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.3.1.</span> Delivery Markets Runs off. The result will be determined by the number of runs added to the team total, off the specified delivery. For example, if an over starts with a wide, then the first delivery will be settled as 1 and, although there has not been a legal ball bowled, the next ball will be deemed as delivery 2 for that over. If a delivery leads to a free hit or a free hit is to be re-bowled because of an illegal delivery, the runs scored off the additional delivery do not count. All runs, whether off the bat or not, are included. For example, a wide with three extra runs taken equates to 4 runs in total off that delivery.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.3.2.</span> Over Markets Runs in Over. The specified over must be completed for bets to stand unless settlement has already been determined. If an innings ends during an over, that over will be deemed to be complete unless the innings is ended due to external factors, including bad weather, in which case all bets will be void, unless settlement has already been determined. If the over does not commence for any reason, all bets will be void. Extras and penalty runs in the particular over count towards settlement.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.3.3.</span> Wicket in Over. For settlement purposes, any wicket will count, including run outs. A batsman retiring hurt does not count as a wicket. If a batsman is timed out or retired out, the wicket is deemed to have taken place on the previous ball. Retired hurt does not count as a dismissal.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.3.4.</span> Over Odd/Even. Description: Will the number of runs scored in the specified over be odd or even? Rules: As “Runs in Over.” Zero will be deemed to be an even number.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.3.5.</span> Innings Markets. In limited overs matches, bets will be void if it has not been possible to complete at least 80% of the overs scheduled to have been bowled at the time the bet was placed due to external factors, including bad weather, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined before the reduction. Bets placed on a future innings will remain valid regardless of the runs scored in any current or previous innings. In drawn First Class matches, bets will be void if fewer than 200 overs have been bowled, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined. Bets will also be void in drawn First Class matches, if less than 60 overs have been bowled in an incomplete innings, unless settlement of the bet has already been determined. If a team declares, that innings will be considered complete for the purposes of settlement.</p>

    <div class="sub-section-title"></div>

    <div class="sub-section-title">1. General</div>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.1.</span> All bets shall be settled based on the official declaration of the result of the race as made by the relevant racing authority on the day of the race.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.2.</span> In the event of a Dead Heat, the bet will be paid out at face value divided by the number of Dead Heating winners of the event.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">1.3.</span> Whilst the sportsbook strives to provide the most up-to-date and accurate data, the sportsbook shall not be liable for any errors regarding the Horses, Greyhound, or Harness racing data.</p>

    <div class="sub-section-title">2. Market Specific Rules</div>

    <p><span class="highlight">2.2.</span> To the market “Place Betting,” the following rules apply:</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">2.2.1.</span> Where there are 8 or more runners in a race, a place shall be paid on first, second, and third places. If a bet is placed when the field has 8 or more runners and the field later reduces to 7 or fewer runners, first, second, and third places will be paid; however, deductions shall apply. See Deductions Table in clause 3.3.5.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">2.2.2.</span> Dead heat rules apply.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.2.</span> Abandoned, Postponed, and Transferred Races</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.2.1.</span> If a race is abandoned or transferred to another venue/track (including transferring to a different track at the same venue) or postponed to another date, single bets shall be void. Affected Combo Bets will be recalculated excluding that Event.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.2.2.</span> Where a race is postponed and rescheduled to take place at the same venue within 48 hours of the original scheduled start time of the race, all bets shall stand as if the race was not postponed.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.2.3.</span> If scratchings are reinstated due to a postponed race at the same venue, all bets shall be void.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.3.</span> Deductions</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.3.1.</span> Any bet may be subject to deduction after the placement of the bet. These deductions are applied to the face value (expected winnings) of the bet.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.3.2.</span> In the case of scratchings after the declaration of the final field and after the bet has been placed, deductions will apply to the face value of the winning bets as per the Deductions table - See Deductions Table in clause 3.3.5.</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">3.3.3.</span> Deduction calculations are specified as a percentage deducted from the amount of the stake’s winnings.</p>
